# Changelog

All notable changes to Idol Stage Timetable will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [3.6.7] - 2026-03-20

### Added
- 🔧 **`fav_slug` recovery UX** — when the favorites token in localStorage is expired or invalid, `my-favorites.php` and `my.php` error screens now show two recovery buttons: "🗑️ Clear from Browser" (removes `fav_slug` from localStorage and redirects to home) and "✨ Create New Favorites" (POSTs to `api/favorites.php?action=create`, saves the new slug to localStorage, and redirects to the new favorites URL) — users no longer need to open developer tools to recover from a stale token
- 🔧 **Silent self-healing in `injectFavNavButton()`** — after injecting ⭐/📅 nav buttons, a background `fetch` validates the stored slug against the server; on 400/404 response it automatically removes `fav_slug` from localStorage and removes the injected buttons
- 🌐 **Translation keys** — added `fav.clearStorage` and `fav.createError` in TH/EN/JA

**📁 Files changed:**
- `my-favorites.php`
- `my.php`
- `js/common.js`
- `js/translations.js`

## [3.6.6] - 2026-03-20

### Added
- 📋 **Table of Contents on How-to-Use page** — `<nav class="toc-section">` renders 18 section links in a 2-column grid (1 column on mobile); each item is an anchor link that jumps directly to the target section; labels use existing `data-i18n` keys and re-render automatically when switching TH/EN/JA
- 🔑 **`toc.title` translation key** — TH `📋 สารบัญ` / EN `📋 Table of Contents` / JA `📋 目次`

### Changed
- 🔀 **Section order reorganized by priority** — Overview → Event Picker → Homepage Calendar → Filtering → Date Jump Bar → Program Detail Modal → Live Stream → Gantt Chart → Calendar View → Save/Export → Artist Profile → Artist Feed Subscribe → My Favorites → Past Events → Submit Request → Language → Mobile → FAQ; all sections have `id="s-*"` attributes for anchor navigation

**📁 Files changed:**
- `how-to-use.php`
- `js/translations.js`
- `styles/how-to-use.css`

## [3.6.5] - 2026-03-20

### Added
- ⚡ **Homepage listing query cache** (`cache/query_listing.json`, TTL 3600s) — caches both `$activeEvents` (from `get_all_active_events()`) and `$listingCalData` (homepage calendar dot data) together in a single file; a cache hit skips both DB queries entirely; a cache miss runs both queries and saves the result; automatically invalidated when any program or event is modified

### Changed
- 🔄 **`invalidate_query_cache()`** — `query_listing.json` added to the invalidation list for both specific-event and global (null) call patterns
- 🔄 **Admin `createEvent()` / `updateEvent()` / `deleteEvent()`** — now call `invalidate_query_cache()` to bust `query_listing.json` when event metadata changes; previously event writes did not invalidate the query cache

**📁 Files changed:**
- `index.php`
- `functions/cache.php`
- `admin/api.php`

## [3.6.4] - 2026-03-20

### Added
- 📅 **Homepage Calendar View** — monthly calendar above the Events listing on the homepage; days with programs show a pink dot; clicking a day opens a modal listing the **Events** (conventions) active on that day — each shown as a mini event card with gradient header (name + date range), status badge (กำลังจัดงาน / กำลังจะมาถึง / จบแล้ว), and "📋 ดูตารางเวลา" button; calendar navigates per month (defaults to current month); shows all active events including past; language-aware month/day labels re-render on language switch

### Changed
- 🎨 **Calendar section title** — `"📅 ปฏิทินกิจกรรม"` header now has `margin-top: 10px` for better visual separation
- 🎨 **Events listing title** — renamed from `"Events"` → `"🎪 รายการกิจกรรม"` (EN: `🎪 Events`, JA: `🎪 イベント一覧`) with icon prefix

**📁 Files changed:**
- `index.php`
- `styles/index.css`
- `js/translations.js`
- `how-to-use.php`

## [3.6.3] - 2026-03-20

### Changed
- 🔔 **My Upcoming Programs — include group programs** — if a followed artist belongs to a group, programs linked to that group are now included automatically in `my.php` and `my-feed.php`; group IDs are resolved from `artists.group_id` and merged into the program query `artist_id IN (...)` set; no changes to followed-artist list or UI

**📁 Files changed:**
- `my.php`
- `my-feed.php`

## [3.6.2] - 2026-03-20

### Added
- 📊 **Admin Events tab — sortable columns** — the Events table in Admin Panel supports sorting by clicking any column header: `#`, `Name`, `Start Date`, `End Date`, `Active`, `Programs`; client-side sort (no API reload required); default sort `Start Date DESC` (newest first); click again to toggle asc/desc; ↕ / ↑ / ↓ icons indicate sort state

**📁 Files changed:**
- `admin/index.php`

## [3.6.1] - 2026-03-20

### Changed
- 🗂️ **Personal feed cache — shard co-location** — personal feed `.ics` cache files moved from `cache/feed_fav_{md5}.ics` (flat directory) into `cache/favorites/{shard}/{token}.ics` (same shard directory as the favorites `.json` file); `fav_cleanup_expired()` GC now deletes both `.json` and `.ics` for expired tokens together; no user-visible behavior change

**📁 Files changed:**
- `my-feed.php`
- `functions/favorites.php`

## [3.6.0] - 2026-03-20

### Added
- 🔔 **Personal ICS Subscription Feed** (`my-feed.php`) — live webcal feed scoped to a user's favorited artists; URL `/my/{slug}/feed` (via `.htaccess`); shows all upcoming programs from followed artists across active events; SUMMARY prefixed with `[Event Name]` for context in calendar apps; RFC 5545 compliant (line folding, CATEGORIES delimiter, VALARM 15-min reminder)
- 🔔 **Subscribe button on My Upcoming Programs** — 🔔 Subscribe button added to the Save URL banner; opens a modal with webcal:// link (Apple Calendar / iOS / Thunderbird) + https:// URL + Copy button + Outlook subscription instructions + sync frequency notice
- 📦 **`functions/ics.php`** — ICS helper functions (`icsLine`, `icsFold`, `icsEscape`, `icsEscapeText`) extracted from `feed.php` into a shared file; both `feed.php` and `my-feed.php` `require_once 'functions/ics.php'`

### Changed
- 🏗️ **`feed.php` refactor** — removed inline function definitions; now delegates to `functions/ics.php`; no behavior change

**📁 Files changed:**
- `my-feed.php` (new)
- `functions/ics.php` (new)
- `feed.php`
- `.htaccess`
- `my.php`
- `tests/FeedTest.php`

## [3.5.4] - 2026-03-20

### Fixed
- 🐛 **Admin artist profile link 404** — artist name links in Admin › Artists were pointing to `/admin/artist/{id}` instead of `/artist/{id}` because `BASE_PATH` resolves from `admin/index.php`'s `SCRIPT_NAME` and returns `/admin`; fixed by adding JS constant `APP_ROOT = dirname(BASE_PATH)` and using `APP_ROOT` for all links pointing to public pages

**📁 Files changed:**
- `admin/index.php`

## [3.5.3] - 2026-03-20

### Fixed
- 🐛 **Admin form HTML entity encoding** — `'` (single quote) and `&` entered in admin forms were being stored and re-displayed as `&#039;` and `&amp;` due to `htmlspecialchars()` being incorrectly applied to JSON API responses; removed `escapeOutputData()` side effects and all standalone `htmlspecialchars()` calls from `admin/api.php` JSON output paths — JSON transport now carries raw data; HTML escaping remains in `admin/index.php` JS layer (`escapeHtml()` on `innerHTML` insertions, `textContent`/`.value` for form fields)

**📁 Files changed:**
- `admin/api.php`

## [3.5.2] - 2026-03-20

### Added
- 📅 **Mini Calendar on My Upcoming Programs** — monthly calendar grid inserted between the "Followed Artists" section and the "Upcoming Programs" list; navigates only between months that have programs (◀ ▶ disabled at boundary); dates with programs show a pink dot; today is highlighted with a filled circle
- 🗓️ **Day Programs Modal** — clicking a date with a dot opens a modal showing all programs for that day in the same format as the list (time, title, type badge, event name, location, categories, Live button); closes on ✕ button, overlay click, or Escape key
- 🌐 **Calendar re-renders on language change** — month/year title, day-of-week headers, and modal date label all update immediately when switching TH/EN/JA
- 🧪 **FavoritesTest** — 84 new automated tests covering the full v3.5.x Favorites system: config constants, UUID v7 format/uniqueness, HMAC determinism, slug build/parse/tamper resistance, file I/O (write→read roundtrip, sharded path), `api/favorites.php` action structure (create/get/add/remove, rate-limit 429, slug validation), `my-favorites.php` solo/group split + sort controls + localStorage preference, `my.php` mini calendar + day modal + XSS-safe `JSON_HEX_TAG`, translations.js 3-language coverage, `js/common.js` nav injection, `artist.php` follow/unfollow, `.htaccess` routing, `how-to-use.php` section17 keys — **total 2036 tests** (13 suites)

### Changed
- 📝 **`how-to-use.php` section17 updated** — My Favorites description updated to mention the solo/group split; A→Z / Z→A sort sub-point added; My Upcoming Programs description updated to "grouped by date"; new "📅 Mini Calendar View" sub-section with 3 bullet points (position, dot indicators, day modal)
- 📝 **`js/translations.js` new keys** — `section17.myfav.sort` and `section17.cal.title` / `section17.cal.feature1-3` added in all 3 languages (TH/EN/JA)
- 📖 **`admin/help.php` + `admin/help-en.php` Artists tab** — three new sub-sections documented: **Copy Artist** (pre-fill behavior, variants checkbox, copy flow), **Bulk Import Artists** (Step 1 textarea → Step 2 results + summary), **Bulk Select & Bulk Actions** (Add to Group / Remove from Group table + `is_group=0` filter callout)

**📁 Files changed:**
- `my.php`
- `how-to-use.php`
- `js/translations.js`
- `admin/help.php`
- `admin/help-en.php`
- `tests/FavoritesTest.php` (new)
- `tests/run-tests.php`

## [3.5.1] - 2026-03-20

### Changed
- 🎤 **My Favorites — split into two sections** — solo artists (🎤) and groups (🎵) are now rendered in separate sections instead of a single mixed list; PHP splits `$artistIds` into `$solos` and `$groups` before rendering
- 🔃 **Sort controls per section** — each section has its own A→Z / Z→A sort buttons; sorting is applied client-side with `localeCompare` (locale-aware, handles Thai/Japanese); active sort button is highlighted; preference is saved to `localStorage` (`fav_sort_solo` / `fav_sort_group`) and restored on page load
- 🌐 **i18n** — new translation keys `fav.soloArtists`, `fav.groups`, `fav.sort`, `fav.sortAZ`, `fav.sortZA` added to TH / EN / JA

**📁 Files changed:**
- `my-favorites.php`
- `js/translations.js`

## [3.5.0] - 2026-03-20

### Added
- 📋 **Copy Artist modal** — "Copy" button on each artist row opens a pre-filled modal (name + " (copy)", same is_group and group_id); a "Variants to copy" section lists all source variants as checkboxes (all checked by default) with "Select all" / "Deselect all" buttons; all fields are editable before saving; after a successful create, selected variants are created one-by-one via `artists_variants_create`
- 👥 **Bulk artist selection + Bulk Add to Group** — per-row checkboxes with a Select All header checkbox; a yellow Bulk Toolbar appears when ≥ 1 artist is selected; "Add to Group" button opens a group picker modal; "Remove from Group" button clears `group_id` for all selected artists; artists with `is_group = 1` are automatically skipped server-side
- 📥 **Bulk Import Artists** — "📥 Import" button in the Artists toolbar; Step 1 modal accepts a newline-separated list (1 name per line, up to 500), an optional "Is Group" checkbox, and an optional target group dropdown; Step 2 shows a per-name result list (✅ created / ⚠️ duplicate / ❌ error) with a summary bar and a "← Back" button to import another batch; artist list auto-refreshes when any artists were created

- 🔒 **Access denied on `/my` and `/my-favorites` without slug** — visiting either page without a personal slug (UUID-HMAC) now shows a 🔒 "Access Denied" screen with a description and a home button, instead of a generic empty state
- 🌐 **Full 3-language support for `/my` and `/my-favorites`** — all UI text uses `data-i18n` attributes; new translation keys `fav.noAccess` and `fav.noAccessDesc` added to TH / EN / JA in `js/translations.js`

### Changed
- 🔄 **Artists table** — added a checkbox column (individual + select-all) for bulk selection
- 🔄 **`my.php` footer** — aligned with `index.php`: "Built with ❤️ for idol fans" tagline, GitHub link, version badge
- 🔄 **`my-favorites.php` footer** — same footer alignment as `index.php`
- 🔄 **`my.php` header nav** — both ⭐ My Favorites and 📅 My Upcoming Programs buttons always shown when slug is present; current page button highlighted (sakura-medium background)
- 🔄 **`my-favorites.php` header nav** — both ⭐ and 📅 buttons always shown when slug is present; current page button highlighted
- 🔄 **`my.php` program sort order** — Upcoming Programs are now sorted by program start datetime across all followed events (date-first grouping), instead of being grouped by event; each date group shows a date header, and each program row shows the event name as inline metadata; programs within the same date are ordered by start time (`ORDER BY p.start ASC`)

### API
- `POST admin/api.php?action=artists_bulk_set_group` — accepts `{ids[], group_id}`; updates `group_id` for multiple artists (`is_group = 0` only); `group_id = null` removes group membership
- `POST admin/api.php?action=artists_bulk_import` — accepts `{names[], is_group, group_id}`; inserts one artist per name; returns `{results: [{name, status, id?}]}` with `created/duplicate/error` statuses; invalidates caches when `created > 0`

**📁 Files changed:**
- `admin/api.php`
- `admin/index.php`
- `config/app.php`
- `my.php`
- `my-favorites.php`
- `js/translations.js`

## [3.4.0] - 2026-03-20

### Added
- ⭐ **Anonymous Favorites system** — users can follow artists without logging in; UUID v7 token + HMAC-signed slug (`{uuid}-{hmac[:12]}`); stored in `cache/favorites/{shard}/{uuid}.json`; TTL 365 days with auto-touch on each visit; `fav_maybe_cleanup()` probabilistic garbage collection
- 📅 **My Upcoming Programs** (`my.php`) — `/my/{uuid-hmac}`; server-side PHP dashboard showing upcoming programs from followed artists, grouped by event and date; Save URL banner (URL + Copy + warning); auto-saves slug to `localStorage`
- ⭐ **My Favorites** (`my-favorites.php`) — `/my-favorites/{uuid-hmac}`; server-side PHP page showing followed artist list with profile links and unfollow buttons; Save URL banner; link button to My Upcoming Programs; auto-saves slug to `localStorage`
- 🔗 **Persistent nav shortcuts** — `injectFavNavButton()` in `js/common.js`; when `fav_slug` exists in `localStorage`, injects ⭐ (`/my-favorites/{slug}`) and 📅 (`/my/{slug}`) as circular icon buttons into `.header-top-left` on all pages; skipped on `/my/` and `/my-favorites/` pages
- 🔌 **Favorites API** (`api/favorites.php`) — `action=follow`, `action=unfollow`, `action=get`, `action=remove`; HMAC validation on all write operations; rate limiting; returns artist details when `?details=1`
- ⚙️ **`config/favorites.php`** — `FAVORITES_DIR`, `FAVORITES_TTL`, `FAVORITES_HMAC_SECRET`, `FAVORITES_HMAC_LENGTH`, `FAVORITES_MAX_ARTISTS`, `FAVORITES_RATE_LIMIT`, `FAVORITES_RATE_WINDOW`, `FAVORITES_RL_DIR`
- 🛠️ **`tools/generate-favorites-secret.php`** — generates a secure 256-bit hex HMAC secret

### Changed
- 🔗 **`.htaccess`** — added `^my-favorites/([0-9a-f-]+)/?$` and `^my/([0-9a-f-]+)/?$` rewrite rules; `^api/favorites/?$` → `api/favorites.php`
- 🎨 **Page titles** — `/my/{slug}` = "📅 My Upcoming Programs"; `/my-favorites/{slug}` = "⭐ My Favorites"
- 🗑️ **Removed how-to-use icon** from event detail header (`index.php`) — reduces icon count on mobile
- 🔄 **`localStorage.fav_slug`** — now a shortcut helper only; auto-saved/replaced when visiting either favorites page via URL
- 🔄 **Follow button toggle** (`artist.php`) — ☆ ติดตาม / ★ ติดตามแล้ว toggles in-place without redirect; first-time follow (no existing `fav_slug`) redirects to `/my-favorites/{slug}`; subsequent follow/unfollow updates button state only

**📁 Files changed:**
- `my.php` (new)
- `my-favorites.php` (rewritten)
- `api/favorites.php` (new)
- `functions/favorites.php` (new)
- `config/favorites.php` (new)

- `setup.php`
- `config.php`

## [3.3.0] - 2026-03-19

### Added
- 🖼️ **Server-side image export** (`image.php`) — replaces html2canvas with PHP GD; generates PNG server-side with no external JS dependency; supports Thai/multi-byte text via TrueType fonts (Sarabun/Noto, fallback to system fonts); `fonts/README.md` added with font download instructions
- 🎨 **Image layout** — Sakura-themed table with alternating row colors; column header; date group headers; program rows with time badge (sakura-medium pink, white text, compact fixed height), title, venue, type badge, artist badges; vertical column separators between fields; footer with site title + generated timestamp
- 📋 **Single-venue image mode** — when `venue_mode=single`, venue column is removed and venue name (from first program) is shown below event title in image header
- 🔔 **Image export uses current filters** — `saveAsImage()` in `js/common.js` passes current URL query params (artist, venue, type, q, event) to `/image` endpoint; `_t` timestamp prevents browser caching
- 🗄️ **Image cache** (`cache/images/`) — generated PNGs cached server-side for 1 hour (key = md5 of event + filters + lang + APP_VERSION); served via `readfile()` on hit; auto-invalidated when programs are created/updated/deleted via `invalidate_image_cache()`; `IMAGE_CACHE_DIR` + `IMAGE_CACHE_TTL` constants in `config/cache.php`
- 🔤 **Three-font architecture** (`image.php`) — `gdText()` / `gdMeasure()` split text into per-character runs and route each character to the correct font: Thai/Latin → main font; Japanese/CJK → `$fontCjk`; BMP symbols → symbol fallback font
- 🔤 **Japanese / CJK font support** — `isCjkCodepoint()` detects Hiragana (U+3040–U+309F), Katakana (U+30A0–U+30FF), Kanji (U+4E00–U+9FFF), CJK Symbols & Punctuation (U+3000–U+303F, covers 【】「」『』 etc.), and Fullwidth Forms (U+FF00–U+FF9F); `$fontCjk` auto-detected via differential pixel test: か (U+304B) vs き (U+304D) — distinct shapes confirm real Hiragana glyphs
- 🔤 **GNU Unifont as shared-hosting CJK fallback** — `unifont.ttf` / `unifont.otf` added to CJK font candidates; users who place Unifont for symbol support automatically get Japanese rendering without additional files; covers full BMP including Hiragana, Katakana, and common Kanji
- 🔤 **SMP Math Alphanumeric normalization** — `gdNormalizeSmp()` converts Mathematical Alphanumeric Symbols (U+1D400–U+1D7FF) to base ASCII before GD rendering since PHP GD/libgd cannot handle 4-byte UTF-8 (SMP) on many systems; 𝗕𝗔𝗖𝗞 𝗜𝗡 𝗧𝗜𝗠𝗘 → BACK IN TIME; `gdMapMathChar()` covers all major letter/digit style ranges (Bold, Italic, Sans-Serif, Monospace, etc.)
- 🔤 **Reliable font detection** — symbol fallback: differential pixel test ♾ (U+267E) vs ★ (U+2605); CJK: か vs き; both use BMP 3-byte UTF-8 (reliable on all GD builds); rejects color/bitmap fonts (CBDT → 0 pixels) and fonts where both chars render as identical .notdef

### Changed
- 🔄 **`saveAsImage()` rewrite** — removed html2canvas lazy-load; replaced with `fetch()` to `/image` endpoint; downloads PNG via Blob URL
- 🔄 **Image cache key includes active font paths** — adding or replacing a font file automatically busts cached images; prevents serving stale PNGs generated before a font was installed
- 🐛 **Japanese labels now render correctly** — column headers (時間 プログラム 会場 タイプ), date group headers (2026年3月19日（水）), and "no programs" message (プログラムなし) were using `imagettftext()` directly (bypassing per-character routing); changed to `gdText()` so Japanese text is correctly routed to `$fontCjk`
- 🐛 **LIVE indicator `●` → `*`** — `●` (U+25CF) rendered as missing-glyph square on some fonts; replaced with ASCII `*` which all fonts support
- 📖 **`fonts/README.md` rewritten for shared hosting** — new structure: Section 1 (Thai font), Section 2 (GNU Unifont — recommended, covers symbols + Japanese in one file), Section 3 (Symbola — symbol-only alternative), Section 4 (dedicated Noto Sans JP — higher quality Japanese); warning about Google Fonts variable font vs static version; recommended setups table
- 🐳 **Dockerfile** — added `fonts-noto-cjk` for proper Japanese rendering in Docker; updated comments to reflect three-font architecture
- 🎨 **Theme-aware image palette** — generated PNG matches the event's theme; `get_site_theme($eventMeta)` is called before the cache check so each theme gets its own cached image; palette lookup table covers all 7 themes (sakura/ocean/forest/midnight/sunset/dark/gray) with per-theme RGB values for: header background (deep), column header (medium), accent badges, date section background, date text, borders, alternating row tint, and venue subtitle; theme is included in the image cache key so switching a theme automatically invalidates previous cached images
- 🐛 **Artist filter mismatch fix** — `image.php` was filtering artists via the `categories` text field while `index.php` uses the `program_artists` junction table (canonical artist names); fixed by reading `program_artists_map` from query cache when available, and querying the `program_artists` table directly when cache is cold; fallback to `categories` text when junction table is absent — mirrors `index.php` `$useArtistsTable` logic exactly
- ⚡ **Image cache key: `xxh128` replaces `md5`** — `hash('xxh128', ...)` is faster than `md5()` for non-cryptographic cache key generation; produces 32 hex chars (same length as md5); PHP 8.1+ built-in
- 🛠️ **`setup.php` v3.3.0 support** — GD extension check (`extension_loaded('gd') && function_exists('imagettftext')`) added as optional requirement in Step 1; `cache/images/` and `fonts/` directories added to Step 2 directory checks; font file detection for NotoSansThai, NotoSansJP, NotoEmoji, Symbola, unifont (all tested and confirmed working); summary badges (Thai/Latin ✅, Japanese/CJK ✅, Symbols/Emoji ✅); font rows displayed inline with directory rows using `check-row` class for consistent margin/padding

**📁 Files changed:**
- `image.php` (new)
- `js/common.js`
- `fonts/README.md` (new)
- `config/cache.php`
- `functions/cache.php`
- `Dockerfile`
- `nginx-clean-url.conf`
- `setup.php`

## [3.2.0] - 2026-03-19

### Added
- **Artist ICS Subscription Feed** (`/artist/{id}/feed`) — live `webcal://` + `https://` feed scoped to a single artist across all events; resolves artist name + all variant names from `artist_variants` table for `categories`-based filtering; cache file `cache/feed_artist_{id}_{hash}.ics` (TTL 1 hour); 404 on unknown artist
- **Group programs feed** (`/artist/{id}/feed?group=1`) — when artist belongs to a group, `?group=1` resolves the `group_id` and filters by group name + group variants; cache key includes `_own` / `_group` suffix
- **`styles/artist.css`** — extracted all inline `<style>` from `artist.php` into a standalone stylesheet (artist header, badges, programs table, toggle, `.btn`, `.btn-subscribe`, `.req-modal-overlay` / modal styles)

### Changed
- **Subscribe buttons on Artist Profile** — header card shows `🔔 <ArtistName>` button; members of a group get a second `🔔 <GroupName>` button for group programs feed; both buttons labeled with the actual name (not generic "Subscribe")
- **`openSubscribeModal(isGroup)` in `js/common.js`** — accepts `isGroup` flag; builds URL as `/artist/{id}/feed` or `/artist/{id}/feed?group=1`; falls back to existing event-feed logic when not on artist page
- **`invalidate_feed_cache()` in `functions/cache.php`** — always deletes `feed_artist_*.ics` alongside event-specific files, since artist feeds span all events
- **`.htaccess`** — new rewrite rule `^artist/([0-9]+)/feed/?$` → `feed.php?artist_id=$1` (placed before the existing artist profile rule)

**📁 Files changed:**
- `feed.php`
- `artist.php`
- `js/common.js`
- `functions/cache.php`
- `.htaccess`
- `styles/artist.css` (new)

## [3.1.0] - 2026-03-19

### Added
- **Query Cache for event page** (`index.php`) — DB query results (programs, venues, types, artists, artist maps, cross-event data) cached as `cache/query_event_{id}.json`; cache key includes `$eventId` (0 = no filter); IcsParser + all PDO queries skipped on cache hit; filtering still applied PHP-side from cached data
- **Query Cache for artist profile page** (`artist.php`) — artist info, members, variants, programs, and group programs cached as `cache/query_artist_{id}.json`; all DB queries skipped on cache hit; derived vars (`$byEvent`, `$groupByEvent`, `$totalPrograms`) re-computed from cached data on every request
- **`get_query_cache(string $filename): array|false`** — reads JSON cache file; returns `false` on miss, expiry, or decode error; uses `filemtime()` for TTL check
- **`save_query_cache(string $filename, array $data): void`** — writes array as JSON with `LOCK_EX` to prevent concurrent write corruption
- **`invalidate_query_cache(?int $eventId): bool`** — deletes `cache/query_event_{id}.json` + `cache/query_event_0.json` (global page); no `$eventId` = delete all `query_event_*.json`
- **`invalidate_artist_query_cache(): bool`** — deletes all `cache/query_artist_*.json` files
- **`QUERY_CACHE_DIR`** and **`QUERY_CACHE_TTL`** constants in `config/cache.php`; TTL default 3600 s; shares the `cache/` directory

### Changed
- `invalidate_all_caches()` — now also deletes `query_event_*.json` and `query_artist_*.json` patterns (used after DB restore)
- Admin API program write operations (create, update, delete, bulk delete, bulk update, ICS import confirm) — now call `invalidate_query_cache()` + `invalidate_artist_query_cache()` alongside existing `invalidate_data_version_cache()` + `invalidate_feed_cache()`
- Admin API artist write operations (create, update, delete) — now call `invalidate_artist_query_cache()` alongside existing `invalidate_data_version_cache()`
- Admin API variant write operations (create, delete) — now call `invalidate_artist_query_cache()` (previously had no cache invalidation)

**📁 Files changed:**
- `config/cache.php`
- `functions/cache.php`
- `index.php`
- `artist.php`
- `admin/api.php`
- `tools/update-version.php`
- `README.md`
- `PROJECT-STRUCTURE.md`
- `ICS_FORMAT.md`

### Fixed
- **`tools/update-version.php` — smart line-by-line replacement** — เปลี่ยนจาก global `str_replace` เป็น line-by-line พร้อม skip patterns; บรรทัดที่เป็น historical version label จะไม่ถูกแทนที่: `(vX.Y.Z+)` (introduced-in label), `**vX.Y.Z+**:` (bold introduced-in), `| vX.Y.Z |` (table Since column), `| **vX.Y.Z**` (Feature Timeline rows), `### vX.Y.Z —` (historical headings), upgrade guide references (`Upgrading from`, `new vX.Y.Z features`, `all vX.Y.Z features`), inline code comments (`= Something vX.Y.Z`)
- **`README.md`, `PROJECT-STRUCTURE.md`, `ICS_FORMAT.md`** — แก้ไข version labels ของ Artist Reuse System features (v3.0.0 → v3.1.0 ผิดพลาดจาก update-version.php ก่อนหน้า) กลับเป็น v3.0.0 ให้ถูกต้อง

## [3.0.0] - 2026-03-18

### Added
- **Artist Reuse System** — `artists` table as single source of truth across all events; artist records reused via `program_artists` junction table.
- **`program_artists` junction table** — many-to-many `programs ↔ artists`; ICS import auto-links CATEGORIES field to `artist_id` by direct name match and variant lookup
- **`artist_variants` table** — stores alias/variant names per artist; manageable via Admin UI variants modal
- **Artist Profile page** (`artist.php`) — `/artist/{id}`; displays all programs grouped by event; shows group members and variant names; `.htaccess` rewrite `^artist/([0-9]+)` → `artist.php?id=$1`
- **Artist Profile programs toggle** (`artist.php`) — pill-style toggle between "Programs ทั้งหมด" (own) and "Programs ในนามวง" (group); shown only when artist belongs to a group; default is own programs; choice persists in `localStorage` per artist
- **Clickable artist badges** — artist badge in program rows is a split pill: left button filters by artist, right `↗` link opens artist profile; uses `program_artists` junction for artist id
- **Artist filter — event count badge** — each artist checkbox shows a pink count bubble when the artist appears in multiple events, plus a `↗` profile link
- **"Also appears in" cross-event section** — rendered before the footer on every event page; groups shared artists by event as flex-wrap cards with artist chips linking to profiles
- **Admin Artists tab** — Variants column shows variant count per artist; Variants button opens modal to add/remove variant names; artist name is a link to the profile page
- **Migration** — `tools/migrate-add-artist-variants-table.php` (idempotent); auto-imports variants from `data/artists-mapping.json`
- **Admin API** — `artists_variants_list`, `artists_variants_create`, `artists_variants_delete`
- **`setup.php` bilingual support (TH / EN)** — language switcher (TH / EN buttons) in setup header; session-based detection (`$_SESSION['setup_lang']`, `?lang=th` / `?lang=en` GET param); all visible UI translated: lock banner, status banners, 6 step titles/badges/labels/descriptions, migration table, config summary, quick links, footer; JS `confirm()` / `alert()` strings injected via PHP `setupI18n` object using `json_encode()` for XSS safety

### Changed
- ICS import (`uploadAndParseIcs`, `confirmIcsImport`) now uses `artist_variants` DB table instead of `data/artists-mapping.json` for auto-linking artist names
- Artist filter in `index.php` reads from `artists` table directly instead of the `categories` text field (falls back to text field if `program_artists` table is absent)
- Admin Programs list — "Categories" column header renamed to **"Artist / Group"**
- Admin Program form — "Categories" label renamed to **"Artist / Group"**; plain text input replaced with **tag-input widget**: artist chips with `×` remove, autocomplete dropdown from `artists` table (🎤 solo / 🎵 group icons), type-and-Enter/comma to add free-text name; new artists created in `artists` table on Save
- Admin Bulk Edit — "Categories" label renamed to **"Artist / Group"**; same tag-input chip widget with autocomplete applied (shared via `createArtistTagInput()` factory function)

### Fixed
- `createProgram()` and `updateProgram()` now call `syncProgramArtists()` — categories edited through Admin UI are reflected in the `program_artists` junction table immediately, so artist filter on the public event page works correctly after saving
- `syncProgramArtists()` auto-creates a new `artists` record (`is_group = 0`) when a category name has no direct name match or variant match, preventing manually typed artist names from being silently dropped

### Added (continued)
- **`artists_autocomplete` Admin API** (`?action=artists_autocomplete&q=...`) — lightweight GET endpoint returning `id`, `name`, `is_group` for matching artists (up to 20; returns top 50 when query is empty); used by the tag-input widget in the program form
- **`createArtistTagInput()` JS factory function** (`admin/index.php`) — shared factory that initializes the tag-input widget for both the single-program form and the Bulk Edit form (different element IDs, same logic); eliminates code duplication; exposes `setValue()` and `reset()` on the returned public API object

**📁 Files changed:**
- `artist.php` *(new)*
- `tools/migrate-add-artist-variants-table.php` *(new)*
- `admin/api.php`
- `admin/index.php`
- `index.php`
- `.htaccess`
- `styles/index.css`
- `setup.php`
- `tests/ProgramTypeTest.php`

### Upgrade Notes

> **ℹ️ Not a breaking change** — existing data and all functionality continue to work unchanged after deploying the new code. Fallback code detects whether the new tables exist and gracefully falls back to the `categories` text field if they don't.

**What works without migration** (out of the box):
- ✅ Programs list, Gantt, Calendar view — unchanged
- ✅ Artist filter — works from `categories` text field (fallback mode)
- ✅ ICS import — works (fallback: skips artist auto-linking if tables absent)
- ✅ All admin operations — unchanged

**What requires migration** (to enable new v3.0.0 features):
- ❌ Artist Profile page (`/artist/{id}`) — empty until `artists` table is populated
- ❌ Split badge pills (filter + ↗ profile link) — shows plain badge instead
- ❌ Event-count bubble on artist filter — hidden
- ❌ "Also appears in" cross-event section — not rendered
- ❌ Admin Artists tab Variants modal — variants column empty

**Migration steps** (run once after deploying):

```bash
cd tools

# 1. Create tables + import variant names from data/artists-mapping.json
php migrate-add-artist-variants-table.php

# 2. Link existing programs to artists via CATEGORIES field
php migrate-artists-from-mapping.php
```

After migration, all v3.0.0 features activate automatically.

## [2.10.2] - 2026-03-13

### Fixed

- **Calendar view day panel language not updating** (`js/common.js`) — when changing language while a day panel was open, the date header in the panel remained in the previous language; fixed by persisting `_calActiveDayKey`/`_calActiveDayEvs` state in `openDayPanel()`, clearing in `closeDayPanel()`, and re-rendering the panel inside `renderAndMountCalendar()` after each language switch
- **PHP 8.5 deprecation: `ReflectionProperty::setAccessible()`** (`tests/run-tests.php`) — removed two `setAccessible(true)` calls that are no-ops since PHP 8.1 and deprecated in PHP 8.5

### Changed

- **CI/CD: PHP 8.4 and 8.5 added to test matrix** (`.github/workflows/tests.yml`) — extended `php-version` matrix from `['8.1','8.2','8.3']` to `['8.1','8.2','8.3','8.4','8.5']`; also added missing migration scripts `migrate-add-stream-url-column.php` and `migrate-add-contact-channels-table.php` to both `test` and `integration-check` jobs

**📁 Files changed:**
- `js/common.js`
- `tests/run-tests.php`
- `.github/workflows/tests.yml`

## [2.10.1] - 2026-03-13

### Fixed
- **`contact.php` long URL overflow on mobile iOS** — added `word-break: break-all` and `overflow-wrap: anywhere` on contact channel `<a>` tags to prevent long URLs from exceeding layout width on narrow screens
- **`credits.php` global view event order** — changed `ksort` to `krsort` so event groups are sorted newest-first (descending by `event_id`); "ทั่วไป" (no event) group moved to last position

**📁 Files changed:**
- `contact.php`
- `credits.php`

## [2.10.0] - 2026-03-13

### Added
- **Contact Channels (DB-driven)** — contact channels moved from hardcoded HTML to SQLite `contact_channels` table; Admin › Contact tab (admin role only) with full CRUD (icon, title, description, url, display_order, is_active); table auto-created via `ensureContactChannelsTable()` on first API call — no manual migration required; `setup.php` `init_database` creates the table on fresh install
- **Disclaimer multilingual** — disclaimer text in 3 languages (TH/EN/JA) editable from Admin › Settings; stored in `cache/site-settings.json` (keys: `disclaimer_th`, `disclaimer_en`, `disclaimer_ja`); `get_site_disclaimer()` helper in `functions/helpers.php`; PHP-side translation patching via inline `<script>` injected between translations.js and common.js
- **Migration script** — `tools/migrate-add-contact-channels-table.php` (idempotent)

### Changed
- **`contact.php`** — contact channels rendered server-side from DB; empty state shown when no channels are configured; disclaimer loaded via `get_site_disclaimer()`; removed "ขอบคุณ" (Thank You) section
- **`js/translations.js`** — added `contact.noChannels` key (TH/EN/JA); removed `contact.section3.*` and `contact.social.*` keys
- **`admin/api.php`** — added actions: `disclaimer_get`, `disclaimer_save`, `contact_channels_list`, `contact_channels_get`, `contact_channels_create`, `contact_channels_update`, `contact_channels_delete`
- **`admin/index.php`** — added Contact tab (desktop + mobile dropdown); Disclaimer textareas in Settings section; channel modal; JS functions: `loadDisclaimerSetting()`, `saveDisclaimerSetting()`, `loadContactChannels()`, `renderContactChannels()`, `openChannelModal()`, `closeChannelModal()`, `submitChannelForm()`, `deleteChannel()`
- **`admin/help.php` + `admin/help-en.php`** — added documentation for Contact tab and Disclaimer settings

**📁 Files changed:**
- `contact.php`
- `js/translations.js`
- `functions/helpers.php`
- `admin/api.php`
- `admin/index.php`
- `admin/help.php`
- `admin/help-en.php`
- `setup.php`
- `tools/migrate-add-contact-channels-table.php`

## [2.9.0] - 2026-03-13

### Added

- ✨ **Nav icon buttons — Contact & How-to-use** — "ติดต่อเรา" and "วิธีการใช้งาน" links removed from `<nav>` text links and replaced with circular icon buttons in `.header-top-left`; envelope SVG for contact, open-book SVG for how-to-use; consistent order across all pages: home → [event-schedule if in event context] → contact → how-to-use → event-picker
- ✨ **Home icon always goes to root** — home icon on `credits.php`, `how-to-use.php`, and `contact.php` previously linked to `event_url('index.php')` (current event); changed to `get_base_path() . '/'` so it always navigates to the root listing page regardless of event context
- ✨ **New event-schedule icon** — calendar SVG icon added between home and contact; appears only when `$eventMeta` is set (viewing in context of a specific event); links back to that event's schedule via `event_url('index.php')`; tooltip translates via `nav.eventSchedule` (TH: ตารางงาน / EN: Event Schedule / JA: イベント)
- ✨ **Event Picker Modal on `credits.php`** — event-picker grid-dots button and full modal added to `credits.php` header (same condition: `MULTI_EVENT_MODE && count > 1`); modal cards link to `credits.php` of the target event instead of `index.php`; `$activeEvents` and `$today` loaded in PHP header; event picker CSS moved from `styles/index.css` → `styles/common.css` so it is available to all pages
- ✨ **`credits.php` event-specific banner** — when viewing credits for a specific event, a prominent glassmorphism banner displays the event name in the header (`font-size: 1.35em, font-weight: 800`, `backdrop-filter: blur(12px)`, white border); replaces the small `event-subtitle` pill
- ✨ **`credits.php` global view grouped by event** — when no event slug is given, credits are grouped into sections by `event_id`; each section header shows a calendar icon + event name as a clickable link to that event's schedule; credits belonging to inactive/deleted events are hidden; "ทั่วไป" section for `event_id IS NULL` credits (no link)

### Changed

- 🎨 **Credits menu renamed to "แหล่งข้อมูลอ้างอิง"** — `footer.credits` and `listing.credits` translation keys updated in all 3 languages (TH: แหล่งข้อมูลอ้างอิง / EN: References / JA: 参考資料); `credits.title` and `credits.list.title` keys updated to Thai for the TH locale; related section headings (`credits.announcements.title`, `credits.channels.title`, `credits.disclaimer.title`) translated to Thai
- 🎨 **`credits.php` page title translated to Thai** — hardcoded fallback text in `<h1>` and `<h2>` updated from "Credits & References" to "แหล่งข้อมูลอ้างอิง"

**📁 Files changed:**
- `index.php`
- `credits.php`
- `how-to-use.php`
- `contact.php`
- `js/translations.js`
- `styles/common.css`
- `styles/index.css`
- `styles/credits.css`

## [2.8.0] - 2026-03-13

### Added

- ✨ **Event Picker Modal** — replaces native `<select>` dropdown for switching events; button is a 38px circular grid-dots icon (top-left, same position as old version badge); modal shows all active events as cards with name, date range, and status badge (Ongoing / Upcoming / Past); currently-viewed event highlighted with a "Viewing" badge
- ✨ **Event Picker search + filter** — real-time search by event name (UTF-8/Thai safe via `data-name` lowercase attribute); status filter tabs (All / Ongoing / Upcoming / Past); both filters combine as AND; "no results" empty state; i18n TH/EN/JA including placeholder
- ✨ **Version moved to footer (all pages)** — app version removed from top-left header badge on all pages including the event listing homepage; now appears inline after "Powered by Stage Idol Calendar" in the footer as `vX.X.X` in monospace on all public pages (`index.php`, `contact.php`, `credits.php`, `how-to-use.php`); `footer-version` CSS class in `styles/common.css`

### Changed

- 🎨 **`index.php` title bar includes event name** — `<title>` renders `[Event Name] - [Site Name]` when viewing a specific event for better social sharing previews (from v2.7.6)
- 🎨 **Gantt bar layout — time + title inline** — time and title on same row (`flex`); type badge below; title truncates with `…` (from v2.7.7)
- 🎨 **Event Picker modal sort order** — events sorted: currently-viewing (top) → ongoing (start DESC) → upcoming (start ASC, nearest first) → past (start DESC); `usort()` in modal render loop; filter tabs still work independently after sort
- 🎨 **Event Picker mobile layout** — bottom-sheet modal (slides up, `border-radius: 16px 16px 0 0`); grid switches to flex list; each row uses CSS grid (2-col: name+date left, badges right) so status badge and "Viewing" badge never overlap or wrap; dates restored on mobile

**📁 Files changed:**
- `index.php`
- `js/common.js`
- `js/translations.js`
- `styles/index.css`
- `styles/common.css`
- `contact.php`
- `credits.php`
- `how-to-use.php`

## [2.7.7] - 2026-03-13

### Changed

- 🎨 **Gantt bar layout — time + title inline** — inside each program bar, time and title are now displayed on the same row (`display: flex; align-items: baseline`) instead of stacked vertically; type badge moves below the row; title truncates with `…` (`white-space: nowrap; text-overflow: ellipsis`) instead of 2-line clamp; makes short bars more readable at a glance

**📁 Files changed:**
- `js/common.js`
- `styles/index.css`

## [2.7.6] - 2026-03-13

### Added

- ✨ **Event name in page title** — `index.php` `<title>` now renders `[Event Name] - [Site Name]` when viewing a specific event (e.g. `Idol Stage Feb 2026 - Idol Stage Timetable`); improves social sharing previews and browser tab clarity; falls back to site name only on the event listing page or when event name equals site name

### Fixed

- 🐛 **`js/common.js` unused variable** — `const lang` in `openCalendarDetailModal()` was declared but never referenced; removed to eliminate lint warning

**📁 Files changed:**
- `index.php`
- `js/common.js`

## [2.7.5] - 2026-03-12

### Fixed

- 🐛 **`feed.php` SUMMARY comma truncation** — `icsEscape()` was escaping commas to `\,` in SUMMARY; some calendar clients (iOS, Outlook) misinterpret `\,` and truncate the event title at that position. Added `icsEscapeText()` for single-value TEXT properties (SUMMARY, LOCATION, DESCRIPTION) that leaves commas unescaped — commas are not value delimiters in these properties, so this is safe and matches Apple Calendar / Google Calendar export behaviour. `icsEscape()` (with comma escaping) is still used for individual CATEGORIES values where comma IS the RFC 5545 value delimiter.
- 🐛 **`feed.php` calendar header properties unescaped** — `X-WR-CALNAME`, `X-WR-CALDESC`, and `PRODID` were outputting `$calName`/`$siteTitle` without any escaping; backslash/semicolon/newline in the event name or site title would produce a malformed ICS header. `X-WR-CALNAME` now uses `icsEscape()` (comma escaped to `\,` to prevent calendar-name truncation at comma in clients); `X-WR-CALDESC` and `PRODID` use `icsEscapeText()` (comma left unescaped as it is plain text).
- 🧪 **FeedTest +11 tests** — `_feed_icsEscapeText()` replica + 7 unit tests + 2 SUMMARY source-check tests + 2 header-escaping source-check tests; total 1630 tests (80 in FeedTest)

**📁 Files changed:**
- `feed.php`
- `tests/FeedTest.php`

## [2.7.4] - 2026-03-12

### Fixed
- 🔒 **`credits.php` inactive event data leak** — same root cause as v2.7.3: inactive slug caused `$eventId = null`, exposing credits from all events; now returns 404 page
- 🔒 **`index.php` `$_SERVER["SCRIPT_NAME"]` JS injection** — replaced bare `echo` with `json_encode()` for `BASE_PATH` constant; prevents JS syntax error if server path contains quotes or backslashes
- 🔒 **`api/request.php` datetime validation strengthened** — replaced lenient `strtotime()` check with `checkdate()` + explicit range checks (`hour ≤ 23`, `minute ≤ 59`, `second ≤ 59`); rejects overflow values such as month 13, Feb 31, or hour 25 that `strtotime()` silently accepted by rolling over
- 🔒 **`functions/cache.php` concurrent write without lock** — `file_put_contents()` in `get_data_version()` and `get_cached_credits()` now uses `LOCK_EX` flag to prevent cache file corruption under concurrent requests
- 🔒 **`admin/api.php` restore without guaranteed auto-backup** — `copy()` return value for auto-backup was ignored in both `restoreBackup()` and `uploadAndRestoreBackup()`; restore now aborts with an error if the auto-backup copy fails (e.g. disk full or permission denied), preventing data loss
- 🔒 **`admin/api.php` ICS upload MIME over-permissive** — removed `application/octet-stream` from allowed MIME types (accepted any binary file); added structural validation that uploaded content contains `BEGIN:VCALENDAR` and `END:VCALENDAR` before parsing
- 🔒 **`admin/api.php` `stream_url` scheme not validated** — `createProgram()` and `updateProgram()` stored any value for `stream_url` including `javascript:` URIs; now validates with `preg_match('/^https?:\/\//i')` and stores `null` for non-http(s) values, preventing stored XSS via stream URL
- 🐛 **`feed.php` TOCTOU race condition on cache read** — `file_exists()` + `readfile()` had a window where the cache file could be deleted (by a concurrent `invalidate_feed_cache()`) between the two calls, causing a PHP warning and empty response; replaced with a single `@file_get_contents()` call that gracefully falls through to regenerate on race loss

**📁 Files changed:**
- `credits.php`
- `index.php`
- `api/request.php`
- `functions/cache.php`
- `admin/api.php`
- `feed.php`

## [2.7.3] - 2026-03-12

### Fixed
- 🔒 **Inactive event data leak** — when a specific event slug was requested but the event was inactive (or did not exist), `get_event_by_slug()` returned `null`, causing `$eventId` to be `null`; `IcsParser` then fetched programs from **all events** instead of returning nothing
  - `feed.php` — returns HTTP 404 instead of serving another event's ICS feed
  - `export.php` — returns HTTP 404 instead of exporting another event's ICS file
  - `api.php` — returns HTTP 404 with an empty JSON array instead of leaking programs from other events
  - `api/request.php` `getEvents()` — returns an empty program list instead of returning programs from all events
  - `index.php` — renders a 404 HTML page with a link back to the homepage instead of displaying programs from all events

### Tests
- 🧪 **3 new tests in `IntegrationTest`** — cover the inactive event scenarios that triggered the data leak; total 1587 tests across 12 suites
  - `testGetEventBySlugReturnsNullForInactiveEvent` — `get_event_by_slug()` must return `null` when `is_active = 0`
  - `testGetEventIdReturnsNullForInactiveEvent` — `get_event_id()` must return `null` when event is inactive
  - `testGetAllActiveEventsExcludesInactiveEvent` — `get_all_active_events()` must not include inactive events

**📁 Files changed:**
- `feed.php`
- `export.php`
- `api.php`
- `api/request.php`
- `index.php`
- `tests/IntegrationTest.php`

## [2.7.2] - 2026-03-12

### Changed
- 🔧 **Rename `$eventMetaId` → `$eventId` across codebase** — the old name was a leftover from the `events_meta` era (before the v1.2.9 table rename to `events`); all public pages, APIs, cache functions, and tests now use the consistent name `$eventId`
  - **Files updated:** `feed.php`, `export.php`, `credits.php`, `index.php`, `api.php`, `api/request.php`, `tools/import-ics-to-sqlite.php`, `functions/cache.php`, `tests/FeedTest.php`
  - No functional changes — rename only

**📁 Files changed:**
- `feed.php`
- `export.php`
- `credits.php`
- `index.php`
- `api.php`
- `api/request.php`
- `tools/import-ics-to-sqlite.php`
- `functions/cache.php`
- `tests/FeedTest.php`

## [2.7.1] - 2026-03-11

### Added
- ✨ **Duration display in calendar detail** — detail modal and day panel now show program duration `(Xh Ym)` next to the time range; computed via `formatDuration()` helper in `js/common.js`

### Fixed
- 🐛 **Calendar view right-edge gap** — replaced `border: 1px solid` on `.month-calendar` with `box-shadow: inset 0 0 0 1px`; physical border was consuming 1px of content area, leaving a visible sub-pixel gap between the rightmost grid column and the border in rows with dark backgrounds (DOW header, trailing empty cells)
- 🐛 **Cell divider pixel-rounding artifact** — changed `.cal-dow` and `.cal-day` from `border-right` to `border-left`; right-side borders can leave a residual strip at the grid's right edge due to pixel rounding across 7 columns; left-side borders eliminate this by anchoring dividers to the leading edge of each column

**📁 Files changed:**
- `js/common.js`
- `styles/common.css`

## [2.7.0] - 2026-03-11

### Added
- 📅 **Calendar View (`venue_mode = 'calendar'`)** — third venue type alongside multi/single, designed for stream/online event schedules
  - Monthly 7-column grid with ◀ ▶ navigation; navigation is restricted to months that have programs (buttons hidden when only one month exists)
  - **Desktop**: per-day program chips — platform icon (📷/𝕏/▶️/🔴) + artist name + time; tap chip → detail modal (header: program title; body: time + Join Live button)
  - **Mobile**: dot indicators per day (up to 3 dots + "+N"); tap day → day panel below grid showing full program list with title, categories, time, type badge, description, and Live button; grid fills full width with `minmax(46px, 1fr)` columns, scrolls on narrow screens
  - All colors use CSS variables — compatible with all 6 themes (Ocean/Forest/Midnight/Sunset/Gray/Dark)
  - XSS-safe: index-based chip registry (`window._calChipEvents`) + panel-specific registry (`window._calDpEvents`) — no JSON in HTML attributes
  - List/Timeline toggle hidden in calendar mode
  - Full i18n: month/day names re-render automatically on language change (TH/EN/JA)
  - Admin Events form: added `Calendar` option to Venue Mode dropdown
  - Updated user guide (`how-to-use.php`) and admin help (`admin/help.php`, `admin/help-en.php`) with Calendar View documentation

**📁 Files changed:**
- `index.php`
- `admin/api.php`
- `admin/index.php`

- `js/translations.js`
- `styles/common.css`

## [2.6.5] - 2026-03-10

### Security
- 🔒 **XSS fix in filter tag removal buttons** — `index.php` onclick handlers for artist/type/venue tag-remove buttons used `addslashes()` (database escaping, not JS-safe) combined with `htmlspecialchars()`; replaced with `json_encode()` + `htmlspecialchars(ENT_QUOTES)` which correctly encodes all special characters for inline JavaScript context
  - **Affected lines**: `index.php:343`, `index.php:370`, `index.php:399`
- 🔒 **Race condition fix in public request rate limiting** — `checkRateLimit()` and `recordRequest()` in `api/request.php` had a TOCTOU race: concurrent requests could all pass the limit check before any recorded, multiplying effective limit; fixed with `flock(LOCK_EX)` wrapping the full read→modify→write cycle
- 🔒 **JSON error handling in rate limit files** — `json_decode()` return value was checked with `!$data` (falsy), silently treating corrupted files as empty; replaced with explicit `json_last_error() !== JSON_ERROR_NONE` check in both `checkRateLimit()` and `recordRequest()`

**📁 Files changed:**
- `index.php`
- `api/request.php`

---

## [2.6.4] - 2026-03-09

### Fixed
- 🐛 **ICS Import preview edit bug** — `editPreviewEvent()` referenced `getElementById('eventTitle')` which does not exist in the DOM (actual ID is `title`), causing `TypeError: Cannot set properties of null` and breaking the ✏️ edit button on all preview rows
- 🐛 **ICS Import preview edit missing fields** — `programType` and `streamUrl` were not populated when opening the preview edit modal, so existing values were lost silently on save
- 🐛 **ICS Import preview edit saved to DB instead of preview** — `saveEvent()` never read `window.previewEditIndex`, so clicking Save in preview-edit mode would POST a new record to the database instead of updating the in-memory preview; fixed by adding an early-return block that updates `uploadedEvents[index]` and re-renders the preview table
- 🐛 **`previewEditIndex` state leak** — `closeModal()` now resets `window.previewEditIndex = null` to prevent preview-edit mode from persisting into subsequent normal add/edit modal opens

**📁 Files changed:**
- `admin/index.php`

---

## [2.6.3] - 2026-03-06

### Fixed
- 🗑️ **ORGANIZER parse error fix (Outlook calendar wipe)** — removed `ORGANIZER` property from VEVENT in `feed.php`; this is the root cause of all events disappearing from Outlook after every subscription pull
  - **Root cause**: `ORGANIZER;CN="event name":mailto:...` applied `icsEscape()` to the CN parameter value, converting `,` → `\,` and `;` → `\;`; RFC 5545 QUOTED-STRING parameters do not use backslash escaping — the literal backslash characters caused Outlook's strict ICS parser to reject the VEVENT and stop processing the entire file; Outlook then cleared all existing calendar entries and imported nothing
  - **Fix**: `ORGANIZER` property removed from VEVENTs entirely (optional in METHOD:PUBLISH feeds); event name is already conveyed via `X-WR-CALNAME` at the VCALENDAR level
  - **Affected endpoint**: `GET /feed` and `GET /event/{slug}/feed`
  - **Impact**: High — all subscribed Outlook calendars would empty on every sync cycle
- 🔄 **ICS feed Cache-Control hardened for CDN/proxy bypass** — `Cache-Control` upgraded from `no-cache` to `no-store, no-cache`; `Pragma: no-cache` added for legacy proxy compatibility
  - **Reason**: `no-cache` alone allows CDN proxies (e.g. Cloudflare) to store the response and serve 304 from their own cache, bypassing origin ETag checks; `no-store` instructs all intermediate proxies not to store the response at all
- 🔄 **ICS feed sync fix for iOS Calendar** — `Cache-Control` changed from `public, max-age=3600` to `no-store, no-cache` so iOS always re-validates with the server on every poll; ETag + 304 Not Modified is still used to avoid re-downloading unchanged content
  - **Root cause**: `max-age=3600` instructed iOS to serve the cached feed for up to 1 hour without contacting the server at all — no `If-None-Match` request was ever sent during that window, so data changes made in the admin panel were invisible to subscribed calendars until the cache expired
- 📅 **DTSTAMP stability fix** — `DTSTAMP` (and new `LAST-MODIFIED`) in each VEVENT is now sourced from the program's `updated_at` database column instead of the current request timestamp
  - **Root cause**: `DTSTAMP` was set to `gmdate('Ymd\THis\Z')` (current time) on every request, so every feed refresh presented all events as newly modified while `SEQUENCE:0` remained constant
  - **Fix**: `DTSTAMP` and `LAST-MODIFIED` now reflect the actual last-edit time of each event; they only change when an admin modifies the program record
  - **Files changed**: `feed.php`, `IcsParser.php` (added `updated_at` to SELECT queries)

**📁 Files changed:**
- `feed.php`
- `IcsParser.php`

- 🔒 **Directory access hardening** — `.htaccess` files in `data/`, `cache/`, `backups/`, and `ics/` previously allowed access from local network ranges (`192.168.0.0/16`, `10.0.0.0/8`); now set to `Deny from all` to prevent direct web access to sensitive files (database, backups, cache) from any IP
  - **Vulnerability**: Users on the same LAN could download `backups/*.db` (full database including password hashes), read `cache/login_attempts.json`, `cache/site-settings.json`, and raw `.ics` files
  - **Fix**: Commented out all `Allow from` rules — effective policy is now `Deny from all` for all four directories
  - **Affected directories**: `data/`, `cache/`, `backups/`, `ics/`
  - **Impact**: Medium (requires attacker to be on the same local network), but could expose full database content
- 🔒 **Path disclosure fix in public API** — `api/request.php` previously leaked server file paths and PDO error details in JSON error responses visible to anyone
  - **Vulnerability**: DB-not-found error returned `'Database file not found: /var/www/...'`; connection failure returned full `PDOException::getMessage()` including internal paths; query failure returned raw SQL error text
  - **Fix**: All three error responses replaced with generic messages (`'Service unavailable'`, `'Failed to fetch programs'`) — internal details no longer exposed
  - **Affected endpoint**: `GET/POST /api/request.php`
  - **Impact**: Low (information disclosure only), but reveals server filesystem layout to unauthenticated users

**📁 Files changed:**
- `data/.htaccess`
- `cache/.htaccess`
- `backups/.htaccess`
- `ics/.htaccess`
- `api/request.php`

---

## [2.6.1] - 2026-03-05

### Fixed
- 🔒 **LIKE SQL Injection prevention** — admin search queries in `listPrograms()` and `listCredits()` now properly escape LIKE wildcard characters (`%`, `_`) before constructing the WHERE clause; added ESCAPE clause to LIKE operators so special characters are treated as literals, not wildcards
  - **Vulnerability**: User input like `a%` would be interpreted as `LIKE '%a%%'` (match anything starting with 'a'), allowing predictable query result manipulation
  - **Fix**: Input is escaped via `str_replace(['%', '_', '\\'], ['\\%', '\\_', '\\\\'], $search)` before being wrapped with wildcards; LIKE clause becomes `title LIKE :search ESCAPE '\\'` which treats escaped characters as literals
  - **Affected endpoints**: `GET /admin/api.php?action=programs_list` (programs search) and `GET /admin/api.php?action=credits_list` (credits search)
  - **Impact**: Low (admin-only, requires login + CSRF token), but essential for defense-in-depth

**📁 Files changed:**
- `admin/api.php`

---

## [2.6.0] - 2026-03-04

### Added
- 📅 **Date Jump Bar desktop scroll** — arrow buttons `◀` `▶` flanking the date buttons strip let mouse users scroll to dates outside the viewport; mousewheel over the strip now scrolls horizontally (`wheel` → `scrollLeft`); thin 3px sakura-tinted scrollbar shown on `@media (hover: hover)` devices only; `updateArrows()` hides the relevant arrow when the strip is already at its start/end
- 🔴 **Live Stream support (`stream_url`)** — new `stream_url TEXT DEFAULT NULL` column in `programs` table stores IG Live / X Spaces / YouTube Live links
  - **Public UI (`index.php`)**: rows with a stream URL get class `program-live` (subtle pink left glow); platform icon (📷 Instagram / 𝕏 X/Twitter / ▶️ YouTube / 🔴 other) + `🔴 เข้าร่วม` join button rendered inline in the title cell
  - **Admin UI (`admin/index.php`)**: `streamUrl` input (type=url) in the program form; list rows show `🔴` badge linked to the live URL; `openEditModal()` / `duplicateEvent()` pre-fill the field; `saveEvent()` includes `stream_url` in the payload
  - **Admin API (`admin/api.php`)**: `listPrograms`, `getProgram`, `createProgram`, `updateProgram`, and `confirmIcsImport` all read/write `stream_url`
  - **Public API (`api.php`)**: `stream_url` included in `$fieldsToEscape` → XSS-safe field in JSON response
  - **ICS Parser (`IcsParser.php`)**: parses RFC 5545 `URL:` property → `stream_url`; `getAllEventsFromDatabase()` SELECTs `stream_url`
  - **Export (`export.php`, `feed.php`)**: emits `URL:<stream_url>` VEVENT property when `stream_url` is not empty
  - **CSS (`styles/index.css`)**: `.program-live`, `.program-live-icon`, `.program-join-btn`, `.program-join-btn:hover`, `.stream-link-badge`
  - **Translations (`js/translations.js`)**: `badge.joinLive` key in TH (`🔴 เข้าร่วม`) / EN (`🔴 Join Live`) / JA (`🔴 参加する`)
  - **Migration (`tools/migrate-add-stream-url-column.php`)**: idempotent `ALTER TABLE` script for existing installs
  - **Setup (`setup.php`)**: `stream_url TEXT DEFAULT NULL` in `CREATE TABLE programs`; `fix_programs_title` migration preserves `stream_url`; `$allTablesOk` checks `$hasStreamUrlColumn`
  - **Tests (`tests/StreamUrlTest.php`)**: 31 new tests (schema, migration idempotency, CRUD, IcsParser URL parsing, admin/public API, export/feed URL: property, public/admin UI, CSS, translations, setup.php) — total **1584 tests** (12 suites)

**📁 Files changed:**

## [2.5.4] - 2026-03-04

### Added
- 📖 **How-to-use expanded** — `how-to-use.php` updated to cover all current end-user features: Filter by Type (section 2 item 3, with renumbering), Subscribe to Calendar (🔔 section 3 item 3 with webcal/Google/Outlook steps), Date Jump Bar (new section), Description Modal/Read More (new section)
- 🌐 **Translation keys** — `js/translations.js` adds `section2.filter3.*`, `section3.subscribe.*`, `section9.*`, `section10.*` in all 3 languages (TH/EN/JA); renumbers `section2.action.title` → 4, `section2.selectedTags.title` → 5, `section2.quickFilter.title` → 6

**📁 Files changed:**
- `how-to-use.php`
- `js/translations.js`

---

## [2.5.3] - 2026-03-03

### Changed
- 🔧 **`GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID` moved to `config/analytics.php`** — extracted GA Measurement ID from `config/app.php` into a dedicated `config/analytics.php`; prevents `tools/update-version.php` from touching the site-specific GA ID when bumping the version; `config.php` bootstrap loads the new file automatically

**📁 Files changed:**
- 🆕 `config/analytics.php`
- `config/app.php`
- `config.php`

---

## [2.5.2] - 2026-03-03

### Added
- ⚡ **Feed static file cache** — `feed.php` now captures generated ICS output via `ob_start()`/`ob_get_clean()` and saves it to `cache/feed_{eventId}_{hash}.ics`; subsequent requests are served with `readfile()` — no SQLite query, no IcsParser instantiation, no event filtering on every hit
- 🔑 **Cache key includes sorted filter params** — `artist[]`, `venue[]`, `type[]` arrays are sorted before hashing so `?artist[]=A&artist[]=B` and `?artist[]=B&artist[]=A` always map to the same cache file
- 🗑️ **`invalidate_feed_cache($eventMetaId)`** — new function in `functions/cache.php`; deletes matching `feed_*.ics` files; when a specific event is invalidated, the global (`feed_0_*.ics`) cache is also cleared; `invalidate_all_caches()` updated to include feed ICS files
- 🔄 **Auto-invalidate on data change** — `admin/api.php` calls `invalidate_feed_cache()` immediately after `invalidate_data_version_cache()` at all 6 program write operations: `createProgram`, `updateProgram`, `deleteProgram`, `bulkDeletePrograms`, `bulkUpdatePrograms`, and `confirmIcsImport`
- ⚙️ **`FEED_CACHE_DIR` + `FEED_CACHE_TTL`** — new constants in `config/cache.php`; TTL default 3600 s (1 hour); directory is the existing `cache/` folder
- 🧪 **FeedTest** — 20 new cache tests added (total 69 / 1276 cumulative)

**📁 Files changed:**
- `feed.php`
- `functions/cache.php`
- `config/cache.php`
- `admin/api.php`
- 🆕 `tests/FeedTest.php` (+20 tests)

---

## [2.5.1] - 2026-03-03

### Fixed
- 🔧 **RFC 5545 line folding** — `feed.php` now folds any ICS property line exceeding 75 octets with CRLF + SPACE continuation; UTF-8 multi-byte character boundaries are respected (Thai characters 3 bytes/char are never split mid-sequence); required for strict RFC 5545 compliance and Outlook parsing
- 🏷️ **CATEGORIES comma delimiter fix** — `feed.php` previously escaped all commas (`\,`) in CATEGORIES via the shared escape function, causing Outlook to treat `Artist1\,Artist2` as a single category; fixed by splitting on `,` first, escaping each value individually (no comma escaping inside values), then rejoining with unescaped delimiter commas — Outlook now correctly shows N separate categories
- ✏️ **ICS text value escaping (`icsEscape()`)** — properly escapes backslash (first), semicolon, comma, and newline per RFC 5545 §3.3.11; used for SUMMARY, LOCATION, DESCRIPTION, ORGANIZER CN; CATEGORIES values go through the same function after being split, so delimiter commas in `implode(',', ...)` are never passed to the escaper
- 📧 **Outlook subscribe instructions** — subscribe modal now shows a dedicated Outlook instruction box (blue highlight) with step-by-step path: Outlook → Calendar → Add calendar → **Subscribe from web** → paste URL; clarifies that `webcal://` is for Apple/iOS/Thunderbird and `https://` is for Google Calendar / Outlook
- 📱 **Mobile action buttons compact layout** — filter buttons changed from `flex-direction: column` (6 full-width rows, ~338px) to `flex-wrap: wrap` with `flex: 1 1 calc(33.33% - 4px)` (3 per row = 2 rows, ~86px); scoped to `.filter-buttons .btn` so modal buttons are unaffected; reduced padding `8px 6px`, font `0.82em`, min-height `40px`
- 📱 **Subscribe modal URL input overflow** — flex container and input now have `min-width: 0` preventing flex overflow on narrow screens; input `font-size` raised to `1rem` (≥16px) to prevent iOS auto-zoom; `overflow: hidden; text-overflow: ellipsis` truncates long URLs instead of pushing the Copy button off-screen

**📁 Files changed:**
- `feed.php`
- `index.php`
- 🆕 `tests/FeedTest.php` (49 tests)

---

## [2.5.0] - 2026-03-03

### Added
- 🔔 **ICS Subscription Feed (`feed.php`)** — live calendar subscription endpoint; subscribe once and your calendar app auto-syncs whenever programs are added or changed; supports `webcal://` (Apple Calendar, iOS, Thunderbird) and `https://` (Google Calendar, Outlook)
  - URLs: `/feed` (all events) and `/event/{slug}/feed` (specific event) via existing `.htaccess` rules — no new rewrite rules needed
  - HTTP caching: `ETag` based on `get_data_version()`, `Cache-Control: public, max-age=3600`; calendar apps receive `304 Not Modified` when data is unchanged
  - Refresh hints: `X-PUBLISHED-TTL:PT1H` (Apple Calendar) + `REFRESH-INTERVAL;VALUE=DURATION:PT1H` (RFC 7986 / Google Calendar)
  - Filter parameters: `?artist[]=X&venue[]=Y&type[]=Z` — same as export.php
  - 15-minute `VALARM` reminder on every event (same as export.php)
- 🔔 **Subscribe button** — `🔔 Subscribe` button (`btn-subscribe`, purple gradient) added to filter action bar alongside Export; opens subscribe modal
- 🔔 **Subscribe modal** — shows webcal:// link (tap to open in Calendar App), https:// URL with Copy button, and Outlook-specific instructions; translations in TH/EN/JA
- 🗑️ **`invalidate_data_version_cache()`** — new function in `functions/cache.php`; deletes `cache/data_version*.json` for a specific event or all events; called by admin/api.php after every programs CRUD operation and ICS import so the feed ETag updates immediately without waiting for the 10-minute cache TTL

### Changed
- ⚡ **Admin programs CRUD triggers data version cache invalidation** — `createProgram()`, `updateProgram()`, `deleteProgram()`, `bulkDeletePrograms()`, `bulkUpdatePrograms()`, and `confirmIcsImport()` in `admin/api.php` all call `invalidate_data_version_cache()` on success; ensures subscribed calendar apps receive fresh data on their next poll after admin changes

**📁 Files changed:**
- 🆕 `feed.php`
- `index.php`
- `js/common.js`
- `js/translations.js`
- `functions/cache.php`
- `admin/api.php`
- `config/app.php`

---

## [2.4.7] - 2026-03-03

### Added
- 📍 **Venue display in single venue mode** — when `venue_mode = single`, a `📍 venue name` line appears below the event name subtitle in the page header; derived from the first entry in `$venues` (aggregated from programs); not shown in multi-venue mode

### Fixed
- 📱 **Event selector dropdown overflow on mobile** — `.program-selector select` now has `max-width: 100%` and `box-sizing: border-box`; on `≤768px` breakpoint `width: 100%; min-width: 0` overrides the desktop `min-width: 200px` so long event names no longer overflow the header

**📁 Files changed:**
- `index.php`

## [2.4.6] - 2026-03-03

### Changed
- 🃏 **Event listing: horizontal card layout** — main event listing page redesigned from vertical cards to horizontal-style cards; gradient header (name + date) spans full width at top, body section shows status badge + description + meta inline with "View Schedule" button on the right; mobile collapses to compact vertical card
- 📖 **Event description modal** — clicking/tapping a truncated description opens a modal with full event info (name, dates, status badge, full description, meta, link); "▼ Read more" chip button appears only when text is actually clamped (`scrollHeight > clientHeight`)
- 👆 **Read-more button: touch-friendly chip** — `▼ Read more` restyled from plain text link to pill-shaped chip with sakura background, border, `min-height: 30px`, and `-webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent` for easier mobile tapping
- 📱 **Program table mobile: compact card redesign** — each program row now renders as a compact card with gradient time strip at top; reduced `tr` padding from 15px → 0 (cells handle own spacing), `td` padding from 8px 0 → 4px 12px; total vertical saving ~120px per card
- ✏️ **Edit button repositioned on mobile** — `program-action-cell` is `position: absolute; top: 33px; right: 8px` inside `position: relative` card; appears as 30×30px icon button in top-right of white body area without adding card height; fixed CSS specificity to override `width: 100% !important` using `.events-table tbody .program-action-cell`
- 🙈 **Empty cells hidden on mobile** — venue, type, and categories cells with no data receive `cell-empty` class and are `display: none !important`; removes all padding/space for empty fields
- ➖ **Removed `-` dash for empty data** — cells show nothing when data is absent (venue, type, categories, title fallback)
- ↔️ **Type + Categories on same line (mobile)** — `program-type-cell` and `program-categories-cell` changed to `display: inline-flex !important; width: auto !important` using higher-specificity selector to beat `td { width: 100% !important }`
- 🏷️ **Badge size unified** — `program-categories-badge` and `program-type-badge` share identical layout properties (`padding: 4px 12px`, `border-radius: 16px`, `font-size: 0.85em`, `margin: 2px 2px 2px 0`); only background/text color differs; mobile override reduces both equally (`padding: 3px 9px`, `font-size: 0.8em`)

**📁 Files changed:**
- `index.php`
- `styles/common.css`

---

## [2.4.5] - 2026-03-03

### Changed
- 🕐 **Collapse same-time display** — when a program's start time equals its end time (HH:MM), only the start time is shown (no `- end time`); applies to List view, Gantt tooltip, and Admin Programs list
- 📅 **Collapse same-date display** — when a convention's start date equals its end date, only the start date is shown on the event listing card (no `- end date`); Admin ICS import preview also collapses same-date and same-time ranges via new `formatDateTimeRange()` helper

**📁 Files changed:**
- `index.php`
- `admin/index.php`

---

## [2.4.4] - 2026-03-03

### Added
- 🔧 **`tools/update-version.php`** — automated version update script; updates `APP_VERSION` in `config/app.php` and 8 documentation files in a single command (`php tools/update-version.php X.Y.Z`); excludes `CHANGELOG.md` and `CLAUDE.md` which require manual content
- 📅 **ICS Export: 15-minute reminder** — every exported VEVENT now includes a `VALARM` component (`TRIGGER:-PT15M`, `ACTION:DISPLAY`) so Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, and other RFC 5545-compliant apps will show a notification 15 minutes before each program

### Fixed
- 🧪 **`IntegrationTest::testDocumentationExists`** — removed `QUICKSTART.md` and `SQLITE_MIGRATION.md` from the docs list after both files were deleted (merged into README.md and PROJECT-STRUCTURE.md in this version)

**📁 Files changed:**
- `export.php`
- `tests/IntegrationTest.php`
- 🆕 `tools/update-version.php`

### Documentation
- 🌐 **Full English translation** — translated `SETUP.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `API.md`, and `PROJECT-STRUCTURE.md` from Thai/mixed to English
- 📝 **README.md Features section updated** — added missing v2.4.x features: Program Types, Quick Filter Badges, Date Jump Bar, Per-Event Theme, Site Title Setting, Setup Wizard; corrected Venue Mode table (List/Timeline toggle is `Visible` in single-venue mode, per v2.3.4 change); updated unit test count to 999 across 10 suites
- 🔀 **Documentation consolidation** — merged `QUICKSTART.md` into `README.md` (expanded Quick Start + Core Features table + Pro Tips section); merged `SQLITE_MIGRATION.md` into `PROJECT-STRUCTURE.md` (Database Schema, Performance benchmarks, and Management sections); deleted both merged source files
- ➕ **`API.md` updates** — added `?type=X` public API filter and `programs_types` admin endpoint (both introduced in v2.4.0 but missing from docs); translated all remaining Thai text

---

## [2.4.3] - 2026-03-02

### Added
- 🧪 **ProgramTypeTest** — 35 automated tests covering all changes in v2.4.x
  - **Schema**: `programs.program_type` column exists and is nullable
  - **Migration**: `tools/migrate-add-program-type-column.php` exists and is idempotent
  - **CRUD**: insert/read/update/delete `program_type` values including NULL
  - **Public API**: `?type=` filter works via `$typeFilter` variable
  - **Admin API**: `programs_types` action, `SELECT DISTINCT program_type`, CREATE/UPDATE/bulk-update handle `program_type`
  - **index.php UI**: `appendFilter()` function, `URLSearchParams`, `$hasTypes` flag, `.event-subtitle`, `data-i18n="table.type"`, clickable badges, `htmlspecialchars(json_encode())` pattern
  - **Translations**: `'table.type'` key present in all 3 languages (Type / Type / タイプ), appearing 3 times
  - **Admin UI v2.4.2**: `sortBy('categories')`, no `sortBy('organizer')`, `event.categories`, no `<th>Organizer</th>`
- 📊 **Total tests: 999** (increased from 964 → 999, all passing across 10 suites)

### Fixed
- 🐛 **setup.php `fix_programs_title` — `program_type` column lost after fix** — this action recreates the `programs` table from `summary` → `title`, but the new `CREATE TABLE` was missing the `program_type` column, causing it to be immediately dropped
  - Added `program_type TEXT DEFAULT NULL` to the `CREATE TABLE` that is always recreated
  - Checks whether `programs_old` already has `program_type`: if yes → includes the column in `INSERT SELECT` to copy values; if no → omits the column from `INSERT` (default is NULL)

**📁 Files changed:**
- `setup.php`
- 🆕 `tests/ProgramTypeTest.php` (35 tests)

---

## [2.4.2] - 2026-03-02

### Changed
- 🗂️ **Admin Programs List: Organizer → Categories** — renamed the "Organizer" column in the Admin Programs table to "Categories" (related artists)
  - Programs list table: header `Organizer` → `Categories`, sort key `organizer` → `categories`, data `event.organizer` → `event.categories`
  - ICS import preview table: header changed from "Organizer" to "Related Artists", data `event.organizer` → `event.categories`
  - The Add/Edit Program form still retains the Organizer field for editing existing data

**📁 Files changed:**
- `admin/index.php`

---

## [2.4.1] - 2026-03-02

### Added
- 🖱️ **Clickable Filter Badges** — click any badge in the table to instantly append a filter, without using the filter fields at the top
  - **Related Artists**: categories are split into individual artist badges — click to append an `artist[]` filter
  - **Type**: type badge in the "Type" column — click to append a `type[]` filter
  - `appendFilter(type, value)` JS function: appends a filter to the URL (doesn't remove existing filters), works with or without pre-existing filters, won't add duplicates
- 📋 **Program Type Column** — separates "Type" into its own dedicated column instead of being embedded in the title cell
  - Column is shown when the event has at least 1 program with a defined `program_type` (`$hasTypes = !empty($types)`)
  - Supports 3 languages (`table.type`: Type / Type / タイプ)
  - Badge is clickable → appends filter by type; rows without a type → display `-`

### Changed
- 🏷️ **Event Name Subtitle** — event name is displayed as a separate subtitle below the site title on the schedule page
  - Moved the event name out of `<h1>` (previously "Site Title - Event Name") into a separate `<div class="event-subtitle">`
  - Always shown when viewing any event's schedule — regardless of whether the dropdown selector is displayed
  - Benefit: when only one event exists in the system, the dropdown won't appear, but the event name still shows clearly below the site title

### Documentation
- 📖 **how-to-use.php updated** — added section "5. Quick filter from badges in the table" to the filtering section in all 3 languages (TH/EN/JA)
  - Describes artist badges (pink) and type badges (blue)
  - Explains append filter behavior (does not remove existing filters)

### Fixed
- 🐛 **SyntaxError in badge onclick** — `json_encode()` returned a string containing `"` which prematurely closed the HTML attribute; fixed with `htmlspecialchars(json_encode(...), ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8')`

**📁 Files changed:**
- `index.php`
- `js/translations.js`
- `how-to-use.php`

## [2.4.0] - 2026-03-02

### Added
- 🏷️ **Program Type System** — type classification system for programs (stage, booth, meet & greet, etc.)
  - `program_type TEXT DEFAULT NULL` column in `programs` table (backward compatible — NULL means no type)
  - Free-text entry: type any program type freely, with autocomplete from existing types in the system
  - **Admin form**: input + datalist in create/edit modal, badge in list view, bulk edit option
  - **Public filter UI**: checkbox group to filter by type (same as artist/venue filter) — shown only when data exists
  - **Program badge**: displays a blue badge above the program name in the main table
  - **Gantt Chart**: shows type label on program bar (small, at the top)
  - **Public API**: `?type=` filter parameter + `action=types` endpoint
  - **ICS Export**: `?type[]=` filter + `program_type` appended to CATEGORIES field
  - Migration script: `tools/migrate-add-program-type-column.php` (idempotent)
  - GitHub Actions: added migration to workflow
- 🏷️ **Program Type in ICS Import** — type can be set in 3 ways (listed in priority order)
  - `X-PROGRAM-TYPE:` field in the VEVENT block (per-event, highest priority)
  - "🏷️ Program Type (default)" field in Admin → Import UI (batch default for web upload)
  - `--type=value` argument when importing via CLI: `php tools/import-ics-to-sqlite.php --event=slug --type=stage`
  - `IcsParser::parseEvent()` now supports the `X-PROGRAM-TYPE:` field

### Fixed
- 🐛 **setup.php `init_database` missing `program_type` column** — `CREATE TABLE programs` in fresh install was missing `program_type TEXT DEFAULT NULL`, causing the status check `$allTablesOk = false` and the bottom button to display incorrectly
  - Added `program_type TEXT DEFAULT NULL` to the `CREATE TABLE` statement in the `init_database` handler

### Documentation
- 📖 **Admin Help Pages updated** (`admin/help.php`, `admin/help-en.php`)
  - Added Program Type field to the Add/Edit Program form table
  - Added X-PROGRAM-TYPE to the Supported ICS Fields table
  - Added section "Setting Program Type on Import" with a table of 3 methods
  - Added FAQ: Setting Program Type when importing ICS
  - Updated Bulk Edit description to include Program Type

### Changed
- ⬆️ **APP_VERSION** → `2.4.0` (cache busting)

**📁 Files changed:**
- `index.php`
- `admin/index.php`
- `admin/api.php`
- `api.php`
- `export.php`
- `IcsParser.php`
- `setup.php`
- `config/app.php`
- `.github/workflows/tests.yml`
- 🆕 `tools/migrate-add-program-type-column.php`

## [2.3.4] - 2026-03-02

### Fixed
- 🗓️ **Gantt Chart not showing in Single Venue Mode** — the toggle switch was hidden by `if ($currentVenueMode === 'multi')`, causing the `#viewToggle` element to not exist in the DOM, and `initializeView()` to not run
  - Removed the `venue_mode === 'multi'` condition — toggle switch now shows in all modes
  - Gantt Chart works in single venue mode (displays 1 column)

### Changed
- ⬆️ **APP_VERSION** → `2.3.4` (cache busting)

**📁 Files changed:**
- `index.php`

## [2.3.3] - 2026-03-02

### Fixed
- 🗓️ **Gantt Chart: programs 4+ not displaying when overlap exceeds 3** — the CSS class `stack-h-N` was designed for only 2 or 3 overlaps, but JS assigned directly from `stackIndex + 1`, causing program 4 to receive `stack-h-4` (1/3 center) which overlapped invisibly with `stack-h-1` and `stack-h-2`
  - Fixed by switching from CSS classes to inline styles dynamically calculated from `stackIndex / stackTotal`
  - Column space is divided equally among all programs regardless of count (N=4 → 25% each, N=5 → 20% each, …)
  - Removed CSS classes `stack-h-1` through `stack-h-5` (no longer used)

### Changed
- ⬆️ **APP_VERSION** → `2.3.3` (cache busting)

**📁 Files changed:**
- `index.php`
- `styles/common.css`

## [2.3.2] - 2026-03-02

### Fixed
- 🕐 **Inconsistent timezone across the system** — no timezone was defined, causing PHP to use the server timezone (Linux/Docker = UTC), resulting in `export.php` converting times incorrectly by ±7 hours
  - Added `date_default_timezone_set('Asia/Bangkok')` in `config/app.php` before all constants
- 🕐 **IcsParser discarding Z suffix** — `DTSTART:20260207T100000Z` (UTC 10:00 = Thailand 17:00) was being stored as `10:00:00` instead of `17:00:00`
  - Fixed `IcsParser::parseDateTime()` to detect the Z suffix and convert UTC → Asia/Bangkok before storing to DB

### Changed
- ⬆️ **APP_VERSION** → `2.3.2` (cache busting)

**📁 Files changed:**
- `config/app.php`
- `IcsParser.php`

## [2.3.1] - 2026-03-02

### Fixed
- 🐛 **Bulk Edit Programs not saving to database** — `bulkUpdatePrograms()` in `admin/api.php` mixed named parameters (`:location`, `:updated_at`) with positional `?` in the same WHERE IN clause
  - PDO does not support mixing both types — `execute()` ran successfully but no rows were updated (silent fail)
  - Fixed to use only named parameters: each ID uses `:id_0`, `:id_1`, … instead of `?`

### Changed
- ⬆️ **APP_VERSION** → `2.3.1` (cache busting)

**📁 Files changed:**
- `admin/api.php`

## [2.3.0] - 2026-03-02

### Added
- 📧 **Event Email Field** — added `email` column to the `events` table
  - Admin › Events form has a "Contact Email" input field
  - Stored as TEXT DEFAULT NULL; invalid email → stored as NULL (server-side `FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL`)
  - Migration script: `tools/migrate-add-event-email-column.php` (idempotent, safe to run multiple times)
- 📅 **ICS ORGANIZER Redesign** — changed the ORGANIZER in ICS export to represent the event/convention instead of the artist
  - `ORGANIZER;CN="Event Name":mailto:email@event.com` — following RFC 5545 semantics
  - Fallback: `noreply@stageidol.local` when no email is set (does not use the artist's email)
- 🧹 **Production Cleanup (Setup Wizard Step 6)** — system for deleting dev/docs files via `setup.php`
  - Check/delete files with grouped checkboxes (Docs, Tests, Tools, Docker, Nginx, CI/CD)
  - Whitelist-based security (prevents path traversal); locked when setup is locked
  - File groups:
    - **Docs**: `README.md`, `QUICKSTART.md`, `INSTALLATION.md`, `DOCKER.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `TESTING.md`, `SQLITE_MIGRATION.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SETUP.md`, `API.md`, `PROJECT-STRUCTURE.md`, `LICENSE`
    - **Tests**: `tests/` directory
    - **Tools**: `tools/` directory
    - **Docker**: `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, `docker-compose.dev.yml`, `.dockerignore`, `.env.example`
    - **Nginx**: `nginx-clean-url.conf`
    - **CI/CD**: `.github/`, `.gitignore`, `quick-test.bat`, `quick-test.sh`
- 🧪 **EventEmailTest** — 19 automated tests for the email field (637 total in the system)
  - Schema: email column nullable, TEXT type
  - CRUD: insert valid/null email, update email, update to null, read-back via SELECT *
  - Validation logic: accepts valid emails, rejects invalid/empty (returns null)
  - ICS ORGANIZER logic: uses event email, falls back to noreply, skips when no event meta
  - Migration: script exists, idempotent when column already present

### Changed
- ⬆️ **APP_VERSION** → `2.3.0` (cache busting)
- 🔧 **`tools/migrate-add-event-email-column.php`** — the migrated table is `events` (not `programs`)

**📁 Files changed:**
- `admin/index.php`
- `admin/api.php`
- `export.php`
- `setup.php`
- `config/app.php`
- 🆕 `tools/migrate-add-event-email-column.php`
- 🆕 `tests/EventEmailTest.php` (19 tests)

## [2.2.1] - 2026-02-28

### Fixed
- 🐛 **setup.php creates programs table with wrong schema** — `CREATE TABLE programs` used `summary TEXT` instead of `title TEXT NOT NULL`, causing Admin › Programs › create new program to fail (`"Failed to create event"`) because the PDOException was hidden by `PRODUCTION_MODE`
  - Fixed `CREATE TABLE programs` to match the actual schema (`title`, `uid NOT NULL`, `start NOT NULL`, `end NOT NULL`, FK `event_id`)
  - Added migration action `fix_programs_title` in `setup.php` for DBs installed with the old setup.php
  - Added Setup Wizard UI button **"Fix programs.title"** (shown when the programs table has `summary` instead of `title`)
  - `$allTablesOk` now also checks `$hasTitleColumn`
- 🐛 **Events listing page shows empty after init database** — `$showEventListing` counted all `$activeEvents` including the default event, triggering the events listing page but skipping the default event in the card loop → empty page
  - Fixed to use `$nonDefaultEvents` (filters out the default slug first) instead of `$activeEvents` in the condition
  - When only the default event exists → fallback to directly displaying calendar view

### Added
- 🌱 **Sample programs seed on Initialize Database** — `setup.php` automatically creates 3 sample programs (Opening Ceremony, Artist Performance, Closing Stage) using today's date as start/end, so the real layout is visible immediately after a fresh install
- 📖 **Admin Help Pages updated: Default Event behavior** (`admin/help.php` + `admin/help-en.php`)
  - Added table "Default Event and Events Listing Page" describing 3 cases (default only / has real events / direct URL access)
  - Added callout explaining that the default event is intentionally hidden from the Events listing page

**📁 Files changed:**
- `setup.php`
- `admin/help.php`
- `admin/help-en.php`

## [2.2.0] - 2026-02-27

### Added
- 📝 **Site Title Editable from Admin UI** — admins can change the site title via the Settings tab
  - Constant `APP_NAME` in `config/app.php` serves as the default/fallback
  - Helper `get_site_title()` in `functions/helpers.php` — reads `cache/site-settings.json` → fallback to `APP_NAME`
  - Admin API actions `title_get` / `title_save` + functions `getTitleSetting()` / `saveTitleSetting()`
  - Settings tab UI: input field + Save button (placed before the Site Theme picker)
  - All public pages: `<title>` and `<h1>` use `get_site_title()` dynamically
  - PHP injects `window.SITE_TITLE` before `translations.js` on every public page
  - ICS export: `PRODID`, `X-WR-CALNAME`, `X-WR-CALDESC` use `get_site_title()`
  - Storage: `cache/site-settings.json` — `{"site_title": "...", "updated_at": ...}` (general-purpose settings file)
- 🌐 **JS Translation Patching IIFE** in `js/translations.js`
  - Self-patching IIFE reads `window.SITE_TITLE` and replaces `'Idol Stage Timetable'` in all translation keys
  - Works automatically when the site title changes — supports all 3 languages
- 📖 **Admin Help Pages updated** to support Site Title
  - Added "📝 Site Title" subsection before "🎨 Site Theme" in the Settings section (TH + EN)

  - Added FAQ: Site Title not updating after saving
- 🧪 **SiteSettingsTest** — 14 new tests (618 total in the system)
  - Tests `get_site_title()`: no cache, reads cache, empty/whitespace fallback, trim, malformed JSON
  - Tests Admin API: `title_get`/`title_save` cases, functions defined, `require_api_admin_role()` guard
  - Tests public pages: `get_site_title()` call, `window.SITE_TITLE` injection
  - Tests `js/translations.js`: has IIFE patching block
  - Tests `APP_NAME` constant is defined and non-empty

### Changed

  - Makes the subtitle descriptive like TH (`'Idol Stage Event Schedule'`) and JA (`'アイドルステージタイムテーブル'`)
  - The brand name remains only in `header.title`

**📁 Files changed:**
- `config/app.php`
- `functions/helpers.php`

## [2.1.1] - 2026-02-27

### Added
- 🎨 **Per-Event Theme** — assign a separate color theme per event
  - `theme TEXT DEFAULT NULL` column in the `events` table
  - `get_site_theme($eventMeta = null)` accepts event meta to resolve the theme by priority:
    1. Event-specific theme (`events.theme`) — if set and valid

    3. Default fallback: `dark`
  - Admin Event form has a theme picker (🌸 Sakura / 🌊 Ocean / 🌿 Forest / 🌙 Midnight / ☀️ Sunset / 🖤 Dark / 🩶 Gray)
  - All public pages pass `$eventMeta` to `get_site_theme()`: `index.php`, `credits.php`, `how-to-use.php`, `contact.php`
  - Migration script: `tools/migrate-add-theme-column.php` (idempotent)
  - Setup wizard support: fresh install creates the `theme` column automatically; existing install has a "+ theme column" button
- 🧪 **ThemeTest added 8 tests** (24 total / 464 in system)
  - Tests priority: event → global → dark fallback
  - Tests null/empty/invalid event theme fallback
  - Tests Admin API supports the theme field

### Changed
- 🎨 **Default theme fallback** changed from `sakura` → `dark`
  - `sakura` is only the base CSS in `common.css` (it has no override file of its own)

### Migration Guide (from v1.2.5)
```bash
# 1. Run schema migration (Breaking change — must do this first)
php tools/migrate-rename-tables-columns.php

# 2. Add database indexes (performance)
php tools/migrate-add-indexes.php
```

### Testing
- 🧪 **324 automated tests** — all passing (PHP 8.1, 8.2, 8.3)

## [1.2.5] - 2026-02-18

### Added

- 👤 **User Management System** — manage admin users through the Admin panel
  - "👤 Users" tab in Admin panel (shown only for admin role)

  - API endpoints: `users_list`, `users_get`, `users_create`, `users_update`, `users_delete`

- 🛡️ **Role-Based Access Control** — role-based permission system
  - 2 roles: `admin` (full access) and `agent` (events management only)
  - `admin` role: access all tabs + manage users + backup/restore
  - `agent` role: access only Events, Requests, Import ICS, Credits, Conventions
  - Defense in depth: PHP hides HTML elements + API-level role checks
  - Prevents lockout: cannot delete self, cannot change own role, cannot deactivate self
  - Must always have at least 1 active admin
  - Config fallback users always have admin role (backward compatible)
  - Role badge shown next to username in header
  - Helper functions: `get_admin_role()`, `is_admin_role()`, `require_admin_role()`, `require_api_admin_role()`

  - Login tries DB first → fallback to config constants (backward compatible)
  - Records `last_login_at` on every successful login
  - Dummy `password_verify` when username not found to prevent timing attacks
  - Migration script: `tools/migrate-add-admin-users-table.php`

  - API endpoint: `POST ?action=change_password`

### Fixed
- 🐛 **Backup Delete Fix** — fixed issue where deleting a backup file showed "Invalid filename"
